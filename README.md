#  OTP-Reuse Lab — EMCC Cybersecurity & Coding Club
This lab demonstrates what happens when a one-time pad (OTP) or key material is reused between different messages.

>  Educational use only — to teach ethical hacking.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open in Colab**

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jadin101777/emcc-otp-reuse-lab/blob/main/otp_reuse_lab.ipynb)

2. **Read or print the handout**
   👉 [Download Printable PDF](otp_reuse_lab_handout_EMCC_v5.pdf)

3. **Follow the steps in the notebook**
   The notebook will generate ciphertexts, guide you through crib-dragging, and explain how reuse destroys secrecy.

##  What You’ll Learn
- How OTP reuse reveals relationships between messages.
- How to perform crib-dragging safely in a sandbox.
- Why key and nonce reuse breaks modern encryption too.
- How to think like an ethical hacker *and* defender.
